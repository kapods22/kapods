Devon: Hello podcast listeners.
It’s me, Devon, with some

5
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:29,389
updates. This is not a full
episode, but I am here to say

6
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:32,449
episode 13 is on the way. I just
finished recording and am

7
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,842
working on editing it as you
listen.

8
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:38,367
But there is more to be excited
for. Episode 13 is our late

9
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:41,332
April Fools episode. Those who
have been listening to our show

10
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,625
since Spring 2023 will know that
in our April Fools episode we

11
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,345
talk about 5 crazy animals, 4
real, 1 I just made up, and you

12
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:51,290
can send in your guesses of
which it is. But this time I’m

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,357
raising the stakes—if you win
you get your very own…

and Cap models!

Sounds: Ta-Da!

17
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:02,402
Devon: Yes, you get two guesses,
and if you guess the fake animal

18
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:05,851
correctly, you can win your very
own set of Chet and Cap models.

19
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,652
Photos will be on the episode
page for episode 13 when it

20

then, keep exploring this

00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:13,503
amazing Kingdom… Animalia. Bye!
