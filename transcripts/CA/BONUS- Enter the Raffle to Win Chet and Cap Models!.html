  <p>THEME MUSIC begins<br><br>DEVON<br>Hello, podcast listeners. It’s me, Devon. Sorry, the next season has gotten a little delayed. We’re hoping to get it out in early 2025, but I don’t yet have an exact date. But I am here now to give you an exciting announcement. Would you like your very own Chet and Cap models to display on your bookshelf, host a podcast with, or chat with about the meaning of life? Well, then this is your lucky month because we are holding a raffle for a set of Chet and Cap models through the end of the month. Submit your name by going to 
    <a href="http://www.kingdomanimaliapod.com/raffle" target="_blank">kingdomanimaliapod.com/raffle</a>
   or the link in the show notes before October first to get a chance to win. That link is also where you can check out photos of the prize. Again, that’s 
    <a href="http://www.kingdomanimaliapod.com/raffle" target="_blank">kingdomanimaliapod.com/raffle</a>
   to get entered. And that’s it until season two.<br><br>MUSIC ends<br><br>END OF EPISODE.</p>
